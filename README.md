A machine learning-based intrusion detection system using the NSL-KDD dataset, implementing various classification algorithms for network attack detection.

## Features

- Data extraction and preprocessing pipeline
- Multiple ML models for attack detection:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Naive Bayes
  - SVM
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Feature importance visualization
- Model performance comparison metrics

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sugam24/Intrusion-Detection.git
   cd Intrusion-Detection
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # OR
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Kaggle API** (for dataset download):
   - Get your API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api)
   - Run:
     ```bash
     kaggle login
     ```

## Usage

1. **Download and prepare dataset**:
   ```bash
   python data_extraction.py
   ```

2. **Run the main analysis**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Dataset

The project uses the [NSL-KDD](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd) dataset, which is an improved version of the KDD Cup 99 dataset for network intrusion detection.

## Results

The system evaluates models based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion matrices
- Feature importance

Sample output includes visualizations of:
- Model performance comparison
- Confusion matrices
- Decision tree structures
- Feature importance rankings
